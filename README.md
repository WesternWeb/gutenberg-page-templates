# gutenberg-page-templates
Create page-templates based on Gutenberg blocks. 

A simple plugin to study Gutenberg and its "new" technology.

This plugin will register a new CPT "Gutenberg Page Templates"
- Create a new template
- add in the blocks (empty or with data)
- Save the CPT

Now with adding new pages, 
a new sidebar is created. Page templates.
Selecting the newly created page template, will insert the blocks into the current page.

This plugin is free to use, and to modify since it is a very rough version.
