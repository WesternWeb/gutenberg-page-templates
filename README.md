# gutenberg-page-templates
Create page-templates based on Gutenberg blocks. 

A simple plugin to study Gutenberg and its "new" technology.

This plugin will register a new CPT "Gutenberg Page Templates"

# How to:
- Create a new template
- add in the blocks (empty or with data)
- Save the CPT

Now with adding new pages, 
a new sidebar is created. "Page template" (on the upper-right side)
Selecting the newly created page template in the dropdown, will insert the blocks into the current page.

(! AND will OVERWRITE any data if already in the current page!)


This plugin is free to use, and to modify since it is a very rough version.
